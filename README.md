# Game Browser
The application is a small web-based single page application (SPA) video game directory for classic arcade games.  

## Getting Started
* Make sure you have ruby 2.3.x or greater [installed]( https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation).
* [Install bundler](https://bundler.io/) using:

	```gem install bundler```

* Rails and other gems are setup in this application.  To install all the dependencies, simply run:

	```bundle install```

	This will install everything you need, except ruby itself.  

* You should be all setup to fire up the rails application.  You can attempt to do so by using the command:

	```bundle exec rails server ```

	and then goto http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
